## Projects

### [Pesticide Use Analysis](https://github.com/dallaorane-wilfred/Pesticide_project)
- **Project Description**: This project aimed to predict the quantity of pesticide substances purchased in different regions of France based on attributes such as classification, toxicity (DJA), and climatic data, like temperature. The analysis helped uncover relationships between climate conditions and the use of pesticides, which could support better agricultural planning and environmental protection.
- **Technologies**: R, Data Science, Statistical Modeling
- **GitHub Repository**: [Pesticide Use Analysis](https://github.com/dallaorane-wilfred/Pesticide_project)

### [Scientific Paper Analysis - AI for Disease Detection](https://github.com/dallaorane-wilfred/Disease_Detection_Paper)
- **Project Description**: A comprehensive analysis of a scientific article exploring how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to detect diseases. The paper discussed the use of machine learning models, such as neural networks, for early diagnosis, with a focus on enhancing patient outcomes through improved disease detection techniques.
- **Technologies**: Research, Literature Review
- **GitHub Repository**: [AI for Disease Detection](https://github.com/dallaorane-wilfred/Disease_Detection_Paper)
